Spring Boot + React Todo List
0630+++
Build a TODO list application
 
## Stories:
 
* As a user, I should be able to login to my account (assume these already exist, we don’t need a new user registration flow)
* As a user, I should be able to create a new TODO list
* As a user, I should be able to rename an existing TODO list
* As a user, I should be able to delete an existing TODO list
* As a user, I should be able to add an item to an existing TODO list
* As a user, I should be able to update an existing item in a TODO list
* As a user, I should be able to delete an existing item from a TODO list
* As a user, I should be able to mark an existing item completed
 
## Technical requirements:
 
Spring Boot
Spring Security
Spring Data JPA
Running on PWS
Use any relational DB on PWS
Fancy UI is not the goal here, so use whatever UI tech you’re comfortable with. Do implement a REST API with Spring that’s communicating with a JS front-end of your choice (e.g. no server-side templating like JSP or Thymeleaf)
